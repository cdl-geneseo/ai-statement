# AI at SUNY Geneseo

## AI and GenAI

***Artificial intelligence (AI)*** is a term usually used to describe either an area of research within computer science, a property that some researchers claim (controversially) belongs or could belong to certain computer systems, or a set of technologies for generating new digital content (text, images, sound, etc.) from existing content.

This document focuses on the last sense of the term, also commonly referred to as ***generative artificial intelligence*** or ***GenAI***. While GenAI isn't new, it suddenly seems to be everywhere: not only in free-standing tools with names such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, DALL-E, and Midjourney, but also, increasingly, as an affordance built into other tools, such as search engines, word-processors, image editors, email and messaging interfaces, mobile devices and apps, coding environments, websites, cars, and household appliances.

## Engaging with GenAI

Given the growing prevalence of GenAI&mdash;in academia, the workplace, and everyday life&mdash;ignoring it is not an option. **Rather, as a campus community we must commit collectively to engaging with this new technology critically, responsibly, and competently.**

*Engaging* with GenAI is not the same as *embracing* it or even *using* it. At a minimum, we must commit to **educating ourselves** about GenAI so that we understand how it works, what it can and cannot do, and how we might begin to navigate some of the issues surrounding it: issues of **trust, transparency, integrity, reliability, and social responsibility**, to name just a few. From this starting point, we can engage one another in discussion of the technology in the classroom and beyond. Where faculty and staff are comfortable engaging students in using GenAI, doing so may create opportunities for collaborative exploration and deeper, richer conversation.

## Establishing clear expectations

Every office on campus should establish **clear expectations regarding acceptable use of GenAI in accomplishing the work of the office**, including when and how GenAI may be used appropriately (if it may be used at all). Consistent with New York State policy on [Acceptable Use of Artificial Intelligence Technologies](https://its.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/03/nys-p24-001-acceptable-use-of-artificial-intelligence-technologies.pdf), GenAI tools should only be employed in ways that involve human oversight, follow principles of fairness and equity, and provide transparency by disclosing when and how such tools have been employed. The same criteria should govern the use of GenAI tools in teaching and learning. In the classroom, faculty should establish clear expectations regarding students' use of GenAI to complete assignments and provide a **statement of these expectations on the course syllabus**. A good statement will provide detailed guidance that distinguishes among different tools and uses, such as idea-generation, problem-solving, outlining, summarizing, search, spelling-correction, and grammar-checking. For their part, students are entitled to know when and how their faculty are using GenAI tools for such purposes as creating assignments and assessments, grading submitted work, and generating communications.

## Engaging responsibly, critically, and competently

Engaging with GenAI **responsibly** means, among other things, recognizing that **certain types of data should *never* be provided to GenAI tools as inputs.** These include

-   data protected by the **Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act** (FERPA), such as education records;
-   **confidential data** of any kind;
-   **personally identifiable information** (PII)---that is, information related to an identifiable individual;
-   **content protected by copyright**. This last category includes original work by **faculty, staff, administrators, and students**. Original works of authorship are under copyright from the moment of their creation and do not require registration to be protected. **While authors may choose to provide as input to GenAI works in which they themselves hold the copyright**, they should do so with caution, understanding the potential for their work to be used as training data by the provider of an AI tool or service. Under the terms of Geneseo's license with Microsoft, Microsoft may not use as training data the content entered into its Copilot AI tool by users logged into the tool with their Geneseo accounts. But users must decide for themselves how reassured they feel by this fact. *Caveat scriptor*.

Engaging with GenAI **critically** means, among other things, recognizing that AI tools replicate the biases and misinformation in their training data, can't distinguish fact from falsehood, frequently invent their own facts (a phenomenon sometimes called "hallucination"), and can't even perform basic calculations or data analysis reliably. It means **understanding that AI is having and will likely continue to have widespread and significant social, economic, political, and environmental effects:** threatening job security, destabilizing conventional understandings around intellectual property, polluting civic discourse, and contributing to climate change---but also leveling the playing field for individuals with certain types of disabilities, opening new avenues for creativity, and providing new tools for advancing individual and public health.

Engaging with GenAI **competently** means, among other things, understanding when and how to best use AI as an effective aid to **brainstorming and creativity**, a useful tool for **condensing and organizing information**, or a powerful means of **surfacing patterns** in large quantities of data. It means, as well, understanding that AI performs these tasks through processes of statistical analysis and inference, *without itself understanding what it is doing*. To most people, the word "intelligence" implies conscious awareness and the ability to reflect on one's own thoughts and actions. At times, GenAI tools may appear to exhibit these properties, but in fact they're nothing more than sophisticated machines for predicting the next plausible word, pixel, or other bit of data.

## Upholding and advancing Geneseo's values

As we engage with GenAI at Geneseo, individually and as a community, we should ask ourselves continuously **how and when we can use this technology in ways that uphold and advance our values.** Below are some questions to consider under our values of learning, creativity, belonging, civic engagement, and sustainability. **Many more questions could be raised in connection with each value**, and some questions could be repeated under more than one value. Those below are simply intended to help get substantive conversations going.

### Learning

-   How does artificial intelligence, in particular generative artificial intelligence, work?
-   Can we use GenAI to improve critical thinking?
-   Can GenAI make learning more equitable?
-   Does GenAI create obstacles for learning? If so, how can we overcome them?
-   As a community of learners, how can we best exchange knowledge, perspectives, and questions about the roles, risks, and opportunities of GenAI in our disciplinary and professional areas?

### Creativity

-   Can we use GenAI to unlock creativity? To create in new ways?
-   What are the opportunities and risks for creators (authors, artists, etc.) in using GenAI?

### Belonging

-   Within our community, who benefits from GenAI? How can we ensure that the benefits are enjoyed inclusively, not exclusively?
-   Does GenAI have corrosive effects on community? (For example, by perpetuating bias or facilitating the spread of misinformation.)

### Civic engagement

-   What is the business model for GenAI tools and services? Outside our community, who benefits from our use of GenAI? Can we trust the providers of these tools and services?
-   Who does the work of sorting and sifting the data used to train GenAI models in order to improve them? What are the working conditions of these "humans in the loop"? How are they compensated for their work?
-   What political remedies are possible or necessary, in the form of laws and regulations, to mitigate the negative effects of GenAI? To expand who benefits from its positive potential?

### Sustainability

-   What are the environmental impacts of GenAI?
-   How do the energy needs of GenAI affect the communities living near the data centers and power sources necessary to fuel it?
-   How can we minimize the negative environmental effects of GenAI at Geneseo?
-   What are the implications of GenAI for the sustainability of Geneseo as an institution and higher education as a civic project?
